# IDL 4 Sparx Enterprise Architect Extension
Sparx Enterprise Architect Extension to generate IDL 4 (RTI Connext DDS) files from the model.

This Extension allows a menu entry to Sparx Enterprise Architect allowing you to generate IDL from any UML Model. 

To use it you must have Enterprise Architect installed in your system. It has been tested with Sparx Enterprise Architect version 10 and version 12.

The IDL generated uses the syntax of the latest version of the [OMG IDL
specification: IDL 4.0](http://www.omg.org/members/cgi-bin/doc?mars/15-04-01.pdf). Note
that the syntax of annotations is not fully compliant with
IDL 4.0. Rather it uses the OMG DDS-XTYPES syntax that provides
backwards compatility with earlier verions of IDL compilers.

Please use the [RTI Community forums](http://community.rti.com) to
discuss the plugin and provide feedback.
